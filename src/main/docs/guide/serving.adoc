You can serve the JSON schemas as part of your API by defining the following controller:

snippet::io.micronaut.jsonschema.test.SchemaController[]

<1> The schemas will be available on the `/schemas` path, which can be customized for your specific needs.
<2> The schemas will be read from the `META-INF/schemas` classpath folder.
<3> Use a `ResourceLoader` to load the schemas optionally adding the required file extension.
