Annotate a bean with link:{api}/io/micronaut/jsonschema/JsonSchema.html[JsonSchema] to trigger the creation of a
schema for it during build time:

snippet::io.micronaut.jsonschema.test.Llama[]

<1> Add the link:{api}/io/micronaut/jsonschema/JsonSchema.html[JsonSchema] annotation.
<2> (Optional) To use Micronaut Serialization as the serialization solution for your application refer to the
    link:https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-serialization/latest/guide/[Micronaut Serialization]
    documentation and add `Serdeable` annotation to the bean.
<3> Add additional required annotations to your bean. See supported annotations in the following sections.
<4> The JavaDoc will be added as schema description.

The following file will be created on the classpath: `META-INF/schemas/llama.schema.json`.
It can be used in your application and will be included in the jar file.
