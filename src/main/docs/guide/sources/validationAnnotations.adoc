By default, properties are not nullable. `jakarta.annotations.Nullable` can be added to make them nullable.
Note, that validation might not correspond to actual bean values, as by default null
values are completely omitted during JSON serialization.

NOTE: Custom validators cannot be supported, as this information is implementation-specific and not available during build time.
