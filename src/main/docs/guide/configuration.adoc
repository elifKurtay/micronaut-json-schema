Schema generation can be configured with properties of the
link:{api}/io/micronaut/jsonschema/JsonSchema.html[JsonSchema] annotation, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.jsonschema.test.RWBlackbird[tags=clazz]

<1> Configure the title and description of the generated JSON Schema.
<2> Set the relative or absolute URL.
This will affect the file name as well as the id by which this schema can be referenced.

The generation can be configured globally by annotating a type with
link:{api}/io/micronaut/jsonschema/JsonSchema.html[JsonSchemaConfiguration]:

snippet::io.micronaut.jsonschema.test.JsonSchemaConfig[tags=clazz]

<1> Set the base URL for all the schemas. It will be prepended to all relative schema URLs.
    Refer to the link:{api}/io/micronaut/jsonschema/JsonSchema.html[JsonSchemaConfiguration] documentation to
    see all configurable parameters.
