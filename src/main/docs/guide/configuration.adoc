Schema generation can be configured with properties of the
link:{api}/io/micronaut/jsonschema/JsonSchema.html[JsonSchema] annotation, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.jsonschema.test.RWBlackbird[tags=clazz]

<1> Configure the title and description of the generated JSON Schema.
<2> Set the relative or absolute URL.
This will affect the file name as well as the id by which this schema can be referenced.

For the previous class, the following file will be created on the classpath: `META-INF/schemas/red-winged-blackbird.schema.json`.
